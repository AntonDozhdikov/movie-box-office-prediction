This repository presents the results of using a “small” 26-factor model to predict the results 
of film distribution of Russian national films.

The data was obtained from open legal sources by collecting information from the site pages
and manually cross-checking the data.

“Open” and freely distributed software was used in the calculations.

The results of the study will be of interest to emerging researchers in the field of data science
and researchers of national film markets.

Any dissemination of information about the research and the use of its results for non-commercial purposes
for the development of art, science and culture is welcomed# movie-box-office-prediction
